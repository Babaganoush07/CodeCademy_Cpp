CHALLENGE
Letâ€™s convert a temperature from Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius (C).

Letâ€™s ask the user what the temperature is using cin!
The formula is the following:
C = (F - 32) / 1.8C=(Fâˆ’32)/1.8

REVIEW
Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.
Write a space.cpp program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

It should ask him what his earth weight is.
Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.
